# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). Security updates are only provided for the latest major release (and any active minor releases if applicable). Older major versions may receive critical security fixes on a best-effort basis.

| Version Range | Supported          |
|---------------|--------------------|
| Latest major  | :white_check_mark: |
| Previous majors | :x: (best-effort only) |

If your project has specific version support needs, update the table accordingly.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, or discussions.**

Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately so we can address them before public disclosure.

### Preferred Method
- If this repository has **GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting** enabled (check the "Security" tab), please use the **"Report a vulnerability"** button there. This is the fastest and most secure way.
- Otherwise, email the report to `[talhaorak.git@gmail.com]` (replace with your actual security contact email).  
  If possible, please use PGP encryption (public key: link or paste if you have one).

### What to Include in Your Report
- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (PoC if possible)
- Affected versions (if known)
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

We greatly appreciate responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your report within **48 hours** and provide a detailed response within **7 days** indicating next steps.

### Disclosure Policy
1. Once the vulnerability is confirmed, we will work on a fix.
2. After the fix is ready, we will coordinate a release (usually within 14–30 days for non-critical issues; faster for severe ones).
3. We will credit you in the release notes and/or security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity).
4. Public disclosure will occur only after the fix is released.

Thank you for helping keep this project and its users safe!
